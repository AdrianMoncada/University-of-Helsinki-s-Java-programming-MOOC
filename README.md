# University-of-Helsinki-s-Java-programming-MOOC
https://java-programming.mooc.fi/

This course is offered by University of Helsinki's Department of Computer Science.

During this course, I learn the basics of computer programming, along with algorithms and object-oriented programming through the Java programming language. 
The course includes comprehensive materials and plenty of programming exercises - all of which are tested using the automatic testing service "Test My Code".

The course is split up into two individual courses: Java Programming I and Java Programming II. Each course consists of seven parts, each with its own exercise set. Completing a single part takes approximately 5-20 hours, and it's recommended reserving at least 10 hours per part, depending on prior skills with computers.
